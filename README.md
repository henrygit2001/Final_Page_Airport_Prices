# Skiplagged-Netlify-Frontend-

This is the Final Product for my Netlify Website that pulls the airline prices to report back to the Discord webhook.

I would like to thank the author of the Skiplagged API, Krishna Glick, for his ceaseless help in helping me battle through all the ceaseless bugs and the blacklisted API. Debugging was not easy and I have to learn things the hard way about the Error 401 and the Heroku errors. I can't thank you enough.

I would like to also thank Code with Pro for his ceaseless help during the initial stages of me struggling to upload to Heroku. The channel was the first I look towards when integrating my Heroku backend with my Netlify frontend. I can't thank you enough.
